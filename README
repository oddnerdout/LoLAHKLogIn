This is where I will be keeping the project files for my League of Legends AutoHotKey script.

Right now the program can take your username and password and login at a time that you desire.

The major limitations of this program USERS BEWARE:
--most likely working with different screen resolutions (I haven't tried it on other PC's)
--the ability to wake the computer from sleep and log in the user
--how to handle the client when a new patch is released
--the script looks for the LoLLauncher.exe in the directory "C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\lol.launcher.exe"  It will break if the launcher does not exist there.
--how to handle the client when the login screen does not allow data entry 15 seconds after launch.

These are the limitations that I hope you will take into account.  Other than that, cheers!


Thanks in advance for the code for a sleep timer given by users on the AutoHotKey Forums!
